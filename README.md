Time To Eat Some Burgers! is a restaurant app that allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Once a user submits a burger's name, the new burger will be displayed in the left-most column under "New Burgers", waiting to be devoured.  To devour a burger, the user will just need to click on the burger name, and it will then be displayed in the next column "Burgers You've Already Eaten".  This app will store every burger in a database, whether they have been devoured or not.

## To get started...

1. Clone this git repository. 

2. Ensure that your SQL server is running. You can do this by typing `mysql.server start` in your terminal.

3. Open the schema.sql file located in the "db" folder in MySQLWorkbench to view the MySQL Database.  

3. Type `npm install` to install all the dependencies found on the package.json file.

Once you have completed the steps above, type `node server.js` and then open the local application on PORT 3000 at the URL: http://localhost:3000/ to start devouring some virtual burgers!  

You can check your SQL database to see your changes and to see which burgers you have already eaten and which are waiting to be devoured.  

**Have fun and stay hungry!** :hamburger:
